# Simple EAS Build Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Build Status

**Build ID**: `69763a3e-4348-4de6-828c-88650a36b0d2`
**Status**: In queue (building on EAS servers)
**Version**: 9 (1.0.6)
**Watch progress**: https://expo.dev/accounts/krank3n/projects/quotemate/builds/69763a3e-4348-4de6-828c-88650a36b0d2

## What's Happening

1. ‚úÖ Project uploaded to EAS Build
2. ‚è≥ Waiting in free tier queue
3. üîÑ Will build automatically when queue position reached
4. üì¶ AAB will be available for download when complete

**Typical wait time**: 10-30 minutes (depends on queue)

## When Build Completes

You'll be able to:
1. Download the AAB from the build page
2. Upload directly to Google Play
3. No certificate issues - uses the original keystore!

## Checking Build Status

**Option 1**: Open the build page
```
https://expo.dev/accounts/krank3n/projects/quotemate/builds/69763a3e-4348-4de6-828c-88650a36b0d2
```

**Option 2**: Run command
```bash
cd /Users/tom/Documents/GitHub/QuoteMate
eas build:list --platform android --limit 1
```

## After Build Completes

1. **Download AAB**: Click download link on build page
2. **Go to Google Play Console**: https://play.google.com/console
3. **Create Release**: Production ‚Üí Create new release
4. **Upload AAB**: Upload the downloaded file
5. **Submit**: Add release notes and submit

## Future Builds (Super Simple!)

```bash
# Update version in android/app/build.gradle
# Then run:
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

That's it! No keystore management, no certificates, just one command.

## What Changed Back

- ‚úÖ Removed local keystore configuration
- ‚úÖ EAS Build handles signing automatically
- ‚úÖ Uses original keystore (Google Play already knows it)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables still work (react-native-dotenv)

## Why This Is Better

**With EAS Build:**
- ‚úÖ One command: `eas build`
- ‚úÖ No keystore management
- ‚úÖ No certificate uploads
- ‚úÖ Just works‚Ñ¢

**With Local Build (what we tried):**
- ‚ùå Manage keystore files
- ‚ùå Update Google Play certificates
- ‚ùå Complex troubleshooting
- ‚ùå More steps to fail

## Troubleshooting

**"Build stuck in queue"**
- Free tier has limited capacity
- Just wait, it will process
- Typically 10-30 minutes

**"Build failed"**
- Check logs at build URL above
- I can help fix any errors

**"Need faster builds"**
- Consider EAS Build paid plan
- Builds start immediately
