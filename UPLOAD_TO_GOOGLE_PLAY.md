## Troubleshooting

### "Upload key certificate doesn't match"

If you see this error after uploading the certificate:

- The AAB might have been uploaded in a previous attempt
- Check the **Releases** section for existing drafts
- Delete the draft and create a new release

### "Version code 9 has already been used"

If you see this error:
- Increment the version in `android/app/build.gradle`
- Change `versionCode` to 10
- Rebuild with `./gradlew clean && ./gradlew bundlePlayRelease`
